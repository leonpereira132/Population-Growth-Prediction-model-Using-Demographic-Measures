This research project dives deep into the various factors and variables that affect population growth and makes use of them to develop potential solutions and machine learning models to forecast the population growth trends. 
The research explores various machine learning algorithms and techniques to measure accurate population growth using demographic variables which are more reliable and numeric based variables to make predictions that will help in environmental sustainability ,social services , urban development and resources allocation of the region.
The prime technique involves creating, improving and applying machine learning models to determine the key demographic variables and gauge how they affect population increase. Once these models are trained ,it will help reduce the need for substantial historical data and help produce results using demographic indicators. The study advances our understanding of the application of machine learning in demographic research and provides insightful information on the creation of population growth prediction models.
